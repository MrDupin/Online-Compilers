# Online-Compilers
Online compilers for C++ and Python.

To use, you need to have downloaded gcc and a Python compiler, and have them added to your system path. When a user connects to your server, they will be greeted by the index.html page. Then, depending on what option they choose, they will be directed to either cpp.php or python.php. Then they can write their code on the left, and the output (including stderr) will appear on the right when they run the code.

Note: The user cannot give input to the console/terminal (for example, via cin).
